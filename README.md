# Fully On-Chain Pro-Rata Order Book

Experimental Solidity/Foundry implementation of a gas-oriented fully-on-chain order-book kernel.

The design keeps authoritative liquidity and matching entirely on-chain, but replaces FIFO within a price level with pro-rata allocation. That lets one taker fill an arbitrary number of makers at the same tick by updating aggregate tick state rather than every maker.

## Core properties

- 65,536 discrete ticks.
- Two-level occupancy bitmap for bounded best-price discovery.
- Exact integer lot accounting for executable liquidity.
- Pro-rata shares at the same tick.
- Lazy maker fill settlement.
- O(1) maker cancellation with respect to maker count.
- No linked-list tombstones or stale-order cleanup.
- IOC and FOK taker flow.
- Exposure-envelope margin reservation.
- Oracle-bounded execution with per-pool risk ceilings.
- ERC-20 collateral custody.
- Pluggable mark-oracle adapter.
- Lazy funding attribution without maker writes during fills.
- Active-quote withdrawal safety.
- Foundry fuzz tests and explicit gas ceilings.
- GitHub Actions mainnet-fork test using real WETH custody.
